        Backend configuration. This is a list of backends you want to offer to the clients. Each backend
        can have a list (at least one is required) of urls which provides the packages offered by this
        backend.

        As japt-proxy is not limited to debian any more, the new type attribute is mandatory.
        At present it should be 'debian' or 'rpm'.

        A full list of available debian mirrors is provided at http://www.debian.org/mirror/list
        Use a mirror next to you. The configuration below is just an example.

        Example:

        In your sources.list there are these entries:

        deb http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/ stable main contrib
        deb http://security.debian.org stable/updates main contrib

        with Japt-Proxy these lines could be changed to:

        deb http://localhost:8080/japt-proxy/debian/ stable main contrib
        deb http://localhost:8080/japt-proxy/debian-security/ stable/updates main contrib

        Japt-Proxy will handle the trailing '/debian/' and '/debian-security/' as the backend name
        and will use the first url in the backend 'debian' resp. 'debian-security' for fetching files.
        If a url in the list fails, Japt-proxy will try the next one automatically.

        Note, that the backend name is also used for building the cache-path. If the cache-dir is
        set to /var/cache/japt-proxy and the backend is called 'debian-security' the cache-dir
        for that backend is /var/cache/japt-proxy/debian-security. If you want to change that
        you can use a dir attribute for the backend tag - Example:

        <backend name="debian-security" dir="/foo" type="debian">...</backend>

        will use /var/cache/japt-proxy/foo as cache-dir

        (mandatory)
